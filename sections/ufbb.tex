\section{Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder}\label{sec:ufbb}

In this section, we describe a modification of the Union-Find decoder, dubbed the \emph{Union-Find Balanced-Bloom} decoder, that increases the Union-Find decoder's code threshold by improving its heuristic for minimum-weight matching. We show that the modified decoder retains a relatively low time-complexity.
