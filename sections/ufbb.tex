\section{Union-Find Balanced-Bloom decoder}\label{sec:ufbb}

In this section, we describe the \emph{Union-Find Node-Suspension} decoder, that increases the Union-Find decoder's code threshold by improving its heuristic for minimum-weight matching. We first introduce the concept of the potential matching weight in \ref{sec:matchingweight}. We describe the data structure required for this decoder in \ref{sec:nodeset}, and the necessary calculations performed on this data structure in \ref{sec:paritydelaysus}, \ref{sec:nodejoin} and \ref{sec:inversion}. The pseudocode is included in \ref{sec:pseudocode}.
