\subsection{Pseudocode}

The full version of the algorithm we have described is given in Algorithm \ref{algo:ufbb}. Note that this pseudocode includes shorted steps included in the pseudocode of the Union-Find decoder \cite{delfosse2017almost}. This is done for clarity on the additions of the Node-Suspension data structure and protocols. The first block 1-4 initilizes the clusters and described the loop of cluster growth. Block 2 contains lines 5-8 and describes the DFS's related to the calculation of node parities and delays, and the DFS of the cluster growth. Block 3 contains lines 9-17 described the combined merging protocols of the Union-Find and Node-Suspension data structures. Node that lines 16-17 contain an extra step to ensure that the vertex-trees are always acyclic. The final block in line 17 is the peeling decoder \cite{delfosse2017linear}.

    Initialize cluster vertex-trees, node-trees and other of UF.\;
    Create the list $\m{L}$ of odd clusters.\;

          Apply DFS's to calculate node parities and delays (Equations \eqref{eq:nodeparity}, \eqref{eq:delayequation}) in partition of even sub-tree;
        }
        Apply DFS from root $n_r$ to all leafs. If $ns=0$ (Equation \eqref{eq:suspension}), grow all boundary edges of vertices in the node a half-edge per the Union-Find decoder, such that grown edges are added to $\m{F}$. If $ns\neq0$, apply $nw=nw+1$ and continue the DFS.\;
      }
      \For(){edge $(u,v) \in \m{F}$}{
        \eIf(){$\codefunc{Find}(u)\neq\codefunc{Find}(v)$}{
          Merge vertex-trees by weighted \codefunc{Union}.\;

    Apply the peeling decoder.
