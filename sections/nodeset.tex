\subsection{Priority-Node data structure}\label{sec:nodeset}

Fortunately, the scale of the PMW calculation and number of recalculations can be minimized by the introduction of a new data structure. 
Consider the previous example of Figure \ref{fig0}. The growth of $v_0$ and $v_2$ are prioritized for a single iteration, such that new (trivial) vertices are added to the cluster on the boundary of $v_0$ and $v_2$. If we repeat the process of PMW calculation, we now find that the PMW's in the new vertices connected to $v_0$ are equal, and the same is true for $v_2$. These regions of equal PMW vertices, together with the vertices they have been added to which are now interior elements of the associated graph, can be used as nodes in a simplified tree representation of the cluster (see Figure \ref{fig1}). 

\begin{definition}
  The node-tree of a cluster $\nset$ is a partition of the cluster such that each element of the partition - a node $n$ - consists of a set of adjacent vertices that are either interior elements in the associated graph or have equal PMW. 
\end{definition}

\Figure[htb](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt){tikzfigs/tikz-figure1.pdf}{The cluster of Figure \ref{fig0} after a round of prioritized growth of $v_0$ and $v_2$. There are regions of vertices that are either interior elements or have equal potential matching weights, which can be represented as nodes with different node radii in the node-tree $\nset$. \label{fig1}}

The boundary vertices of equal PMW of a node which has grown prioritized are now located at a larger distance from the interior non-trivial vertex or syndrome than those of delayed growth. This property of the node can be stored as the \textbf{node radius} $nr$, which can be used to calculate the PMW of a node without $\vset$. For the example in Figure \ref{fig1}, the PMW of $n_0$ is $nr_0 + (n_1, n_2) + 1$.

The calculation of the PMW on the node-tree $\nset$ rather than the vertex-tree $\vset$ offers a reduction in the cost. However, it is still no trivial task as the entire tree must be considered for the calculation in each node. Instead, we will compute for the \textbf{node suspension}, which relates closely to the PWM. 
\begin{definition}
  The node suspension is the number of growth iterations needed to reach the maximum PMW in the node-tree. 
\end{definition}
For example, the node suspension for $\nset = \{n_0, n_1, n_2\}$ of the cluster in Figure \ref{fig0} is $\{0, 2, 0\}$ and $\{0, 1, 0\}$ in Figure \ref{fig1}, as half-edges are added per growth iteration. 

There are different types of nodes which determines the way in which the node suspension is calculated, which is detailed in Section \ref{sec:paritydelaysus}. The nodes with a non-trivial vertex or syndrome at its center is dubbed a \textbf{syndrome-node} $sn$. These are the nodes we have encounted so far in Figures \ref{fig0} and \ref{fig1}. If two syndromes are located an even manhattan-distance on the lattice, their growths will simultaneously reach some vertex that lies on equal radii of both associated nodes, such as in Figure \ref{fig2}. For this reason, such vertices will always initialize a second type \textbf{junction-node} $jn$ in the combined node-tree.

\Figure[htb](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt){tikzfigs/tikz-figure2.pdf}{Two different types of nodes. Syndrome-nodes $sn$ have a non-trivial vertex or syndrome at its center. Vertices that lie on the radii of two existing nodes initialize a junction-node $jn$ in the node-tree.\label{fig2}}

The Priority-Node data structure, which exists to prioritize zero node suspension growth, does not replace but coexists with the Union-Find data structure, which allows for differentiation between clusters. However, the Priority-Node data structure does require change in the Union-Find data structure. The node-trees are connected, acyclic graphs, which deponds upon that the vertex-trees of the Union-Find data structure are also always acyclic. The maintenance of these acyclic vertex-trees can be done in constant time and is equivalent to the post-growth depth-first-search (DFS) of the cluster as in the original UF decoder.
